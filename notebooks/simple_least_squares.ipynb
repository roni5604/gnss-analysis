    "# Calculating Receiver Position from Android Raw GNSS Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook was written by [Mitchell Johnson](https://www.johnsonmitchelld.com/). The source code, as well as the gnssutils Python package containing the EphemerisManager module, can be found on [Github](https://github.com/johnsonmitchelld/gnss-analysis).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite navigation is absolutely fascinating. The GPS receiver in your smartphone uses concepts as diverse as orbital mechanics, digital signal processing, convex optimization, and the theory of relativity to determine your location anywhere on Earth within seconds. From the development of GPS in the 80's until the early 2010s, satellite navigation was a specialized tool, used primarily by the military, airlines, surveyors, and private citizens fortunate enough to own an expensive personal receiver. Widespread GNSS receiver adoption in smartphones over the past decade, combined with the development of new GNSS constellations from China and the EU, have commoditized satellite navigation like never before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these changes, GNSS receivers were mostly black boxes until recently. Most standalone receivers output only a final position, velocity, and time solution, with dilution of precision and satellite signal-to-noise ratios included if you're lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "That changed in 2016 with Google's introduction of the [raw GNSS measurement API](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/gnss) in Android 7. Several applications have since been developed to make use of this data, including Google's own [GnssLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.location.gps.gnsslogger&hl=en_US&gl=US), which provides an interface for logging raw GNSS measurements to a text file. It is now possible for any of the billions of Android device owners worldwide to experiment with raw GNSS measurement data for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's still missing is an approachable, easy-to-use platform for processing this data. Google's recent paper, Android Raw GNSS Measurement Datasets for Precise Positioning, contains the following table listing publicly available software packages for GNSS positioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](simple_least_squares_files/gnss_software_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that all of the open source options are either written in C/C++ or MATLAB. C and C++ are highly performant languages, but neither is particularly approachable without a software engineering background. MATLAB is much more familiar to engineers and scientists, but I believe its widespread use is harmful for reasons I outline [here](https://www.johnsonmitchelld.com/opinion/2020/12/20/stop-teaching-matlab.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this void in approachable GNSS software packages built on open source platforms, I decided to develop my own. This Jupyter notebook, along with the accompanying EphemerisManager class, provide everything a user needs to calculate the position of their Android phone using recorded GNSS measurements. All that's necessary (in addition to the phone, of course) is an environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to thank the developers of the tools listed above. I used Google's [GPS Measurement Tools](https://github.com/google/gps-measurement-tools) and the European Space Agency's [GNSS resources](https://gage.upc.edu/tutorials/) as references while developing this project, in addition to many other sources mentioned below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Aquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment below was conducted with a sample dataset I collected with Google's GnssLogger app on my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus while driving through downtown Seattle. If you'd like to collect your own data and process it with this notebook, you can find the code and documentation [here](https://github.com/johnsonmitchelld/gnss-analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The import process and data directory determination below assume that the Python interpreter's working directory is the same as this notebook, and that the gnssutils package and data repository are located in the parent directory. If that is not the case, you'll have to modify accordingly."

    "## Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Those with experience in GNSS data processing will probably notice that we're missing a few important fields for calculating receiver position. For each satellite the process requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time of signal transmission** - in order to calculate the satellite's location when the signal was transmitted\n",
    "* **Measured pseudorange** - a rough estimate of the distance between each satellite and the receiver before correcting for clock biases, ionospheric delay, and other phenomena which we'll explain later\n",
    "* **Ephemeris parameters** - a set of parameters required to calculate the satellite's position in space\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, the only one provided directly by Android's raw GNSS measurement API is the time of signal transmission, labeled `ReceivedSvTimeNanos`. Fortunately, the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems Agency (GSA) published a very helpful [white paper](https://www.gsa.europa.eu/system/files/reports/gnss_raw_measurement_web_0.pdf) explaining the parameters reported by Android and how they can be used to generate the values we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ephemeris parameters are an exception. The Android API technically has commands for obtaining these, but they don't seem to work on my Galaxy S9 - at least not in the GnssLogger app. Instead we'll get them from the [International GNSS Service](https://igs.org/mgex/data-products/#data) (IGS), which maintains an array of GNSS data products available to the public through NASA's Crustal Dynamics Data Information System, the German Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie (BKG), and the French Institut Géographique National (IGN). More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timestamp Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first: what time were these measurements taken?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out this question isn't as simple as it might sound. The GPS system has its own time scale, which differs from UTC by some number of leap seconds. Leap seconds are used to adjust UTC for changes in the rotation of the Earth, and are decided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service. If you're interested in reading more about leap seconds and international time standards, you can check out this [FAQ](https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/nist-time-frequently-asked-questions-faq) from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to need a Python `datetime` timestamp for each measurement in order to determine which ephemeris files to retrieve from IGS. To get one, let's calculate the GPS time in nanoseconds using the equations from Section 2.4 of the GSA's white paper. Then we'll convert it to a normal Unix timestamp using the `Pandas.to_datetime()` function with the GPS reference epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the UTC flag is set to True in the `Pandas.to_datetime()` method. The timestamp column needs to be in UTC because the ephemeris files provided by IGS are labeled by UTC date and time. Since Python's datetime library defaults to local time on some systems, it was necessary to keep everything timezone-aware to avoid mix-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This nomenclature is a bit confusing since we're using the `to_datetime()` method to create a column called `UnixTime`, not `Utc`. Unix time and UTC are technically in the same time zone, but UTC includes leap seconds, while Unix time does not. Since we're creating a timestamp from the number of seconds elapsed since the GPS epoch, the resulting timestamp could differ from UTC by some number of leap seconds. That's close enough to ensure we get the correct ephemeris file, and it won't affect the actual position calculations because we don't use the `UnixTime` column for those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's split the data into measurement epochs. We do this by creating a new column and setting it to 1 whenever the difference between a timestamp and the previous timestamp is greater than 200 milliseconds using the `DataFrame.shift()` command. Then we use the `Series.cumsum()` method to generate unique numbers for the individual epochs."

    "A brief geometry lesson is in order before I continue. If you ask someone on the street what their location is, they will most likely provide you with some sort of named landmark for reference, e.g. a street name, intersection, or address. Not every location on Earth has a named landmark nearby for reference, so most children learn about the concept of latitude and longitude in school. \n",

    "Latitude, longitude, and altitude (LLA from here on) together make up a [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system), which was developed over millennia by geographers for use in celestial navigation. Latitude, longitude and altitude are handy because they quickly give you an idea of where you are generally on Earth - positive latitudes are in the northern hemisphere, positive longitudes west of the Prime Meridian, etc. However, spherical coordinates tend to complicate the math involved with satellite navigation because they are not linear. One degree of latitude equals roughly 69 miles (111 km) at the equator but only 49 miles (79 km) at 45 degrees north or south.\n",

    "The Earth-centered, Earth-fixed ([ECEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF)) coordinate system solves this issue. It is a Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates on X, Y, and Z axes which rotate with the Earth. Satellite navigation systems perform most of their calculations in ECEF coordinates before converting to LLA for user output; hence our function for calculating satellite position will output ECEF coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ENU/NED\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge arises when calculating the vector **between** two points on Earth. A linear coordinate system is also desired in this case. However, ECEF doesn't quite work for relative positioning on Earth's surface, because, for example, the X and Y axes can point east, west, up, down, or somewhere in between depending on your location. Hence a third system called [local tangent plane coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_tangent_plane_coordinates) is used to define vectors between coordinates. The most common of these are east, north, up (ENU) and north, east, down (NED), which we will use later.\n",

    "Calculating satellite position from ephemeris data is a bit involved, but the details are conveniently laid out in Tables 20-III and 20-IV of the GPS [Interface Specification Document](https://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-200L.pdf). The function below performs this calculation, taking a Pandas dataframe with the ephemeris parameters for every satellite and a dataseries containing the transmit time for all received signals in seconds since the start of the current GPS week. It also calculates the satellite clock offsets for the given transmission time."
